here instead of a gltf modal i wanna load a fbx building modal. how would i make this change?

# Plan for Converting GLTF to FBX Loading in BuildingModel.tsx

To convert the component from loading a GLTF model to an FBX model, we need to:

1. Replace `useGLTF` with `useFBX` hook from @react-three/drei
2. Update the default model path to point to an FBX file
3. Adjust the loading and handling logic as needed for FBX
4. Update the preload mechanism

Here's the implementation:

```tsx:src/components/BuildingModel.tsx
import { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useFBX } from '@react-three/drei';
import { useSceneStore } from '../store/sceneStore';
import { Mesh, Group, MeshStandardMaterial } from 'three';

// Use FBX model instead of GLTF
const DEFAULT_MODEL_PATH = '/models/house1/result.fbx';

interface BuildingModelProps {
  modelPath?: string;
}

export const BuildingModel = ({ modelPath = DEFAULT_MODEL_PATH }: BuildingModelProps) => {
  const group = useRef<Group>(null);
  const setBuildingModelLoaded = useSceneStore(state => state.setBuildingModelLoaded);
  
  // Use useFBX instead of useGLTF
  const model = useFBX(modelPath);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    if (model) {
      // Clone the model to avoid modifying the cached original
      const modelClone = model.clone();
      
      // Apply PBR materials for better realism
      modelClone.traverse((child) => {
        if ((child as Mesh).isMesh) {
          const mesh = child as Mesh;
          
          // Make sure all meshes can receive shadows
          mesh.receiveShadow = true;
          mesh.castShadow = true;
          
          // Add userData for building elements
          mesh.userData.type = 'building';
          
          // Apply material adjustments if needed
          if (mesh.material) {
            // Adjust material properties for better lighting response
            if (Array.isArray(mesh.material)) {
              mesh.material.forEach(mat => {
                if (mat instanceof MeshStandardMaterial) {
                  mat.roughness = 0.7;
                  mat.metalness = 0.2;
                }
              });
            } else if (mesh.material instanceof MeshStandardMaterial) {
              mesh.material.roughness = 0.7;
              mesh.material.metalness = 0.2;
            }
          }
        }
      });
      
      // Add the model to our group ref
      if (group.current) {
        // Clear any previous models
        while (group.current.children.length > 0) {
          group.current.remove(group.current.children[0]);
        }
        
        // Add the new model
        group.current.add(modelClone);
        
        // Position and scale the building appropriately
        // Adjust position to center the model and place it on the ground
        group.current.position.set(0, -20, 0);
        group.current.scale.set(0.8, 0.8, 0.8); 
        
        // Mark the building as loaded in the store
        setBuildingModelLoaded(true);
      }
    }
    
    // Clean up function
    return () => {
      if (group.current) {
        while (group.current.children.length > 0) {
          group.current.remove(group.current.children[0]);
        }
      }
    };
  }, [model, setBuildingModelLoaded]);
  
  return (
    <group ref={group} />
  );
};

// Note: useFBX doesn't have a preload method like useGLTF
// We can manually preload the FBX if needed using Three.js FBXLoader
// For now, removing the preload line
```

## Key Changes:

1. Replaced `useGLTF` with `useFBX` from @react-three/drei
2. Changed the default model path from a GLTF file to an FBX file
3. Updated how the model is accessed (`const model = useFBX(modelPath)` instead of destructuring)
4. Removed the preload functionality since `useFBX` doesn't have a built-in preload method like `useGLTF`

Note that the FBX model structure might be different from GLTF, so you might need to adjust the positioning, scaling, and material handling based on your specific FBX model. The scale and position values (-20 height and 0.8 scale) may need to be adjusted for your FBX model.

# Potential Issues When Switching from GLTF to FBX

While the component itself will load the FBX model after our changes, there are several considerations to ensure everything else in your project works correctly:

## Likely Issues

1. **Model Structure Differences**
   - FBX models often have different hierarchies and naming conventions than GLTF
   - The scale, rotation, and position values (0.8 scale, -20 position) will likely need adjustment for your specific FBX

2. **Material Handling**
   - FBX materials don't always map 1:1 with GLTF materials
   - PBR material properties might need different adjustments for FBX

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - FBX files are typically larger than GLTF files and may load slower
   - FBX doesn't support draco compression like GLTF does

4. **Project-Specific Interactions**
   - If other parts of your code expect specific node names or structures from your GLTF model, those might break
   - Any code that interacts with the model might need updates

## Required Changes

1. **Add FBX Support Dependencies**
   - Ensure you have the dependencies needed for FBX loading:
   ```bash
   npm install three-stdlib
   ```

2. **Material/Texture Adjustment**
   - You may need to manually adjust material mappings if your FBX materials aren't equivalent to your GLTF ones

3. **Scene Integration**
   - Test interactions with lighting, shadows, and other scene elements
   - FBX models might need different scaling or positioning to appear correctly

4. **Animation Support** (if applicable)
   - If your model has animations, the way they're accessed will differ between GLTF and FBX

The best approach is to implement the change, then test thoroughly to identify any issues with lighting, positioning, material appearance, or interactions with other components. Be prepared to make additional adjustments to properly integrate the FBX model into your existing lighting simulation.
