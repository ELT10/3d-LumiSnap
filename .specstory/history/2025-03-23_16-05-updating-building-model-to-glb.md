i want to update the current building model to glb file available in @house2 . how to do this

# Building Model Update

I'll update the `BuildingModel` component to use the new GLB file from the house2 folder. The key changes needed are to update the default model path and potentially adjust the positioning/scaling for the new model.

```typescript:src/components/BuildingModel.tsx
// ... existing code ...
const DEFAULT_MODEL_PATH = '/models/house2/house.glb';
// ... existing code ...
```

Let's also adjust the positioning and scaling, as the new model might have different dimensions:

```typescript:src/components/BuildingModel.tsx
// ... existing code ...
        // Position and scale the building appropriately
        // Adjust position to center the model and place it on the ground
        group.current.position.set(0, 0, 0); // Reset position to see how new model sits
        group.current.scale.set(1, 1, 1);  // Reset scale to default
        
        // Mark the building as loaded in the store
        setBuildingModelLoaded(true);
// ... existing code ...
```

Finally, make sure to update the preload call at the bottom of the file:

```typescript:src/components/BuildingModel.tsx
// ... existing code ...
// Preload the model for better performance
useGLTF.preload(DEFAULT_MODEL_PATH); 
```

After making these changes, you'll need to adjust the position and scale values based on how the new model appears in your scene. The initial values I've set (position at origin, scale at 1) provide a starting point to see the model's natural size and position, which you can then fine-tune.

If the new model has a significantly different structure, you might also need to adjust material properties in the traversal section, but that would be determined after seeing how the model renders initially.

I'll implement the changes to use the new house2 model in the BuildingModel component.

---

Read file: src/components/BuildingModel.tsx

---

Now I'll implement the changes to use the new house2 model:

---

```diff
  
  // Use the new house model
- const DEFAULT_MODEL_PATH = '/models/house1/result.gltf';
+ const DEFAULT_MODEL_PATH = '/models/house2/house.glb';
  
  interface BuildingModelProps {
          // Position and scale the building appropriately
          // Adjust position to center the model and place it on the ground
-         group.current.position.set(0, -20, 0);
-         group.current.scale.set(0.8, 0.8, 0.8); 
+         group.current.position.set(0, 0, 0);
+         group.current.scale.set(1, 1, 1);
          
          // Mark the building as loaded in the store
```

---

The changes have been implemented successfully. The BuildingModel component now:

1. Uses the new house2 model from the path `/models/house2/house.glb`
2. Sets an initial position at (0, 0, 0) to see how the new model sits naturally
3. Uses a default scale of (1, 1, 1) for initial rendering

You may need to fine-tune the position and scale values after seeing how the new model appears in your scene. The current values provide a starting point where you can see the model's natural dimensions and position, which you can then adjust as needed for proper placement in your scene.
