# Adding a New Fixture with IES File

Based on the code provided, here's how to add a new lighting fixture with an IES file:

## Step 1: Add the IES file to the project

Place your new IES file in the `/public/ies/` directory where the existing files (grazer.IES and spot.ies) are located.

## Step 2: Update the SAMPLE_FIXTURES array

You need to add a new fixture entry to the SAMPLE_FIXTURES array in FixturePanel.tsx:

```typescript:src/components/FixturePanel.tsx
// ... existing code ...
const SAMPLE_FIXTURES = [
  {
    id: 'fixture-1',
    name: 'Ceiling Spotlight',
    manufacturer: 'LightCorp',
    type: 'spotlight',
    iesProfile: '/ies/spot.ies',
    thumbnail: '/thumbnails/spot.jpg'
  },
  {
    id: 'fixture-2',
    name: 'Grazer',
    manufacturer: 'LightCorp',
    type: 'grazer',
    iesProfile: '/ies/grazer.ies',
    thumbnail: '/thumbnails/grazer.jpg'
  },
  // Add your new fixture here
  {
    id: 'fixture-3', // Use a unique ID
    name: 'Your New Fixture Name',
    manufacturer: 'Manufacturer Name',
    type: 'your-fixture-type', // Define a unique type identifier
    iesProfile: '/ies/your-new-file.ies', // Path to your new IES file
    thumbnail: '/thumbnails/your-thumbnail.jpg' // Path to thumbnail image
  },
];
// ... existing code ...
```

## Step 3: Add a thumbnail image

Make sure to add a corresponding thumbnail image in the `/public/thumbnails/` directory for your new fixture.

## Additional Notes:

1. The `type` property should be a unique identifier that represents the fixture type (similar to 'spotlight' or 'grazer' in the existing fixtures).

2. The code automatically handles:
   - Displaying the fixture in the panel
   - Making it draggable
   - Adding it to the scene when clicked

3. If your new fixture requires special rendering or behavior different from existing fixtures, you might need to update the rendering logic elsewhere in your codebase.

4. If your thumbnail image isn't available yet, the code will display the first letter of the fixture name as a placeholder.

This approach integrates seamlessly with your existing fixture panel and lighting system!
