instead of here, i want the delete to be a function when i select a fixture, along with move,rotate and scale

I'll modify the fixture panel to remove the delete buttons and implement a selection-based approach for fixture manipulation. This requires changes to both the panel and adding selection functionality.

---

```diff
    const lightFixtures = useSceneStore(state => state.lightFixtures);
    const setDraggedFixtureData = useSurfaceStore(state => state.setDraggedFixtureData);
+   const setSelectedFixture = useSceneStore(state => state.setSelectedFixture);
+   const selectedFixtureId = useSceneStore(state => state.selectedFixtureId);
    const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
    const [fixtures] = useState<FixtureCatalogItem[]>(SAMPLE_FIXTURES);
    };
    
-   const handleDeleteFixture = (id: string) => {
-     if (window.confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this fixture?')) {
-       removeFixture(id);
-     }
+   const handleSelectFixture = (id: string) => {
+     setSelectedFixture(id);
    };
    
        </div>
        
-       {/* Active fixtures section with delete buttons */}
+       {/* Active fixtures section - now selectable instead of deletable */}
        <div className="active-fixtures-section">
          <h3>Scene Fixtures</h3>
          <div className="active-fixtures-list">
            {lightFixtures.length > 0 ? (
              lightFixtures.map(fixture => (
-               <div key={fixture.id} className="active-fixture-item">
+               <div 
+                 key={fixture.id} 
+                 className={`active-fixture-item ${selectedFixtureId === fixture.id ? 'selected' : ''}`}
+                 onClick={() => handleSelectFixture(fixture.id)}
+               >
                  <div className="fixture-info">
                    <div className="fixture-name">{fixture.name}</div>
                    <div className="fixture-type">{fixture.type}</div>
                  </div>
-                 <div className="fixture-controls">
-                   <button 
-                     className="fixture-delete-button"
-                     onClick={() => handleDeleteFixture(fixture.id)}
-                     title="Delete Fixture"
-                   >
-                     Ã—
-                   </button>
-                 </div>
                </div>
              ))
```

Now I need to update the scene store to include the selection functionality and implement a transform controls component.

---

Read file: src/store/sceneStore.ts

---

I need to fix the linter error in the FixturePanel component and create a new TransformControls component.

Cancelled
