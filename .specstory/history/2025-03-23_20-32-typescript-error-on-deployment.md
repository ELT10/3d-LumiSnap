Let me look at the file with the error and fix it.

Read file: src/utils/duplicationManager.ts

I see the issue. The file imports `useSurfaceStore` from '../store/surfaceStore' but doesn't actually use it anywhere in the code, causing the TypeScript error. Let me fix that by removing the unused import.

---

```diff
  import * as THREE from 'three';
  import { useSceneStore } from '../store/sceneStore';
- import { useSurfaceStore } from '../store/surfaceStore';
  
  /**
```

---

I've removed the unused import of `useSurfaceStore` from the duplicationManager.ts file. This should fix the TypeScript error `TS6133: 'useSurfaceStore' is declared but its value is never read.` that was causing the build to fail during deployment.

Now you should be able to run the build successfully without this error. If there are any other issues during deployment, please let me know.
