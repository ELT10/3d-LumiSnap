Let me check the IESLoader implementation to debug this error.

Let's first look at the IESLoader.ts file to find the source of the error.

---

Read file: /Users/eltonthomas/Developer/3d-lighting/src/utils/IESLoader.ts

---

Now let's look at the useIESLoader hook:

---

Read file: /Users/eltonthomas/Developer/3d-lighting/src/hooks/useIESLoader.ts

---

I need to look at the lines mentioned in the error stack trace to identify the exact issue:

---

Read file: /Users/eltonthomas/Developer/3d-lighting/src/utils/IESLoader.ts

---

Now let's check around line 72 in the IESLoader.ts file:

---

Read file: /Users/eltonthomas/Developer/3d-lighting/src/utils/IESLoader.ts

---

Now I need to check the actual IES file that's being loaded to see if it's malformed:

---

Could not resolve URI: Error: Unable to resolve nonexistent file '/public/ies'

---

Let me check where the IES files might be stored:

---

Could not resolve URI: Error: Unable to resolve nonexistent file '/public'

Let's examine the problematic spot.ies file:

---

Read file: /Users/eltonthomas/Developer/3d-lighting/public/ies/spot.ies

---

I see the issue. The error is occurring because the IES file doesn't have the expected format. Looking at both the file and the error, the problem is on line 166 of IESLoader.ts where it's trying to call `.trim()` on an undefined line.

The issue is likely in this section of IESLoader.ts:

```typescript
for (let v = 0; v < verticalAnglesCount; v++) {
  if (currentIndex >= currentLine.length) {
    currentLine = lines[lineIndex++].trim().split(/\s+/).map(Number);
    currentIndex = 0;
  }
        
  const candela = currentLine[currentIndex++] * multiplier;
  values.push(candela);
  maxCandela = Math.max(maxCandela, candela);
}
```

When `lineIndex` goes out of bounds and there are no more lines, `lines[lineIndex]` returns undefined, and then the code tries to call `.trim()` on that undefined value.

Let's fix the IESLoader.ts file:

---

```diff
        lineIndex++;
      }
+     
+     // Check if TILT= was found
+     if (lineIndex >= lines.length) {
+       throw new Error('Invalid IES format: TILT= not found');
+     }
      
      // Skip TILT line
      lineIndex++;
+     
+     // Check if we have enough lines
+     if (lineIndex >= lines.length) {
+       throw new Error('Invalid IES format: unexpected end of file after TILT=');
+     }
      
      // Parse lamp count, lumens per lamp, multiplier, number of vertical angles, 
      // Skip metadata lines
      lineIndex += 3;
+     
+     // Check if we have enough lines for vertical angles
+     if (lineIndex >= lines.length) {
+       throw new Error('Invalid IES format: unexpected end of file before vertical angles');
+     }
      
      // Parse vertical angles
      for (let i = 0; i < verticalAnglesCount; i++) {
        if (currentIndex >= currentLine.length) {
+         // Check if we have more lines
+         if (lineIndex >= lines.length) {
+           throw new Error(`Invalid IES format: unexpected end of file while parsing vertical angles (got ${verticalAngles.length} of ${verticalAnglesCount})`);
+         }
          currentLine = lines[lineIndex++].trim().split(/\s+/).map(Number);
          currentIndex = 0;
      const horizontalAngles: number[] = [];
      if (currentIndex >= currentLine.length) {
+       // Check if we have more lines
+       if (lineIndex >= lines.length) {
+         throw new Error('Invalid IES format: unexpected end of file before horizontal angles');
+       }
        currentLine = lines[lineIndex++].trim().split(/\s+/).map(Number);
        currentIndex = 0;
      for (let i = 0; i < horizontalAnglesCount; i++) {
        if (currentIndex >= currentLine.length) {
+         // Check if we have more lines
+         if (lineIndex >= lines.length) {
+           throw new Error(`Invalid IES format: unexpected end of file while parsing horizontal angles (got ${horizontalAngles.length} of ${horizontalAnglesCount})`);
+         }
          currentLine = lines[lineIndex++].trim().split(/\s+/).map(Number);
          currentIndex = 0;
        for (let v = 0; v < verticalAnglesCount; v++) {
          if (currentIndex >= currentLine.length) {
+           // Check if we have more lines
+           if (lineIndex >= lines.length) {
+             throw new Error(`Invalid IES format: unexpected end of file while parsing candela values (h=${h}, v=${v})`);
+           }
            currentLine = lines[lineIndex++].trim().split(/\s+/).map(Number);
            currentIndex = 0;
```

---

Now let's check and fix the actual spot.ies file. Looking at the content, it appears that the candela values are split across multiple lines but there's an issue with the line count or format. Let me edit the spot.ies file to ensure it follows the correct format:

---

```

---

I've made two important changes to fix the issue:

1. Added robust error checking in the IESLoader.ts file to properly handle cases where it encounters an unexpected end of file or missing data.

2. Fixed the formatting of the spot.ies file by:
   - Putting all vertical angles on a single line (previously split across two lines)
   - Putting all candela values on a single line (previously split across two lines)

The error occurred because the file had line breaks in the middle of data sections that the parser wasn't handling correctly. The IESLoader was trying to access a line that didn't exist when it reached the end of the file.

These changes should resolve the error by ensuring:
1. The IES file format is correct with consistent data layout
2. The parser has proper error handling for various edge cases related to file formatting

The error message "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'trim')" should no longer occur as the code now checks if a line exists before attempting to call trim() on it.

Looking at the updated error message, the problem is now in the IES file structure. The parser expects certain metadata lines after the counts line, but they're missing from your IES file.

Let's fix the spot.ies file to match the required format:

---

```diff
  1 1000 1.0 37 1 1 1 1.0 1.0 0.0
  1.0 1.0 50.0
+ 0.0 0.0
+ 0.0
  0.0 5.0 10.0 15.0 20.0 25.0 30.0 35.0 40.0 45.0 50.0 55.0 60.0 65.0 70.0 75.0 80.0 85.0 90.0 95.0 100.0 105.0 110.0 115.0 120.0 125.0 130.0 135.0 140.0 145.0 150.0 155.0 160.0 165.0 170.0 175.0 180.0
  0.0
```

---

Let's also modify the IESLoader to be more flexible with the metadata lines after the counts line:

---

```diff
      const totalLumens = lampCount * lumensPerLamp;
      
-     // Skip metadata lines
-     lineIndex += 3;
+     // Skip metadata lines - be flexible about how many to skip
+     // Some IES files have 1 line, some have 3, we'll check for numeric values
+     while (lineIndex < lines.length) {
+       const nextLine = lines[lineIndex];
+       // If the next line contains vertical angle values (should be numeric), break out
+       if (/^[\s\d.-]+$/.test(nextLine) && nextLine.split(/\s+/).filter(Boolean).length > 0) {
+         break;
+       }
+       lineIndex++;
+     }
      
      // Check if we have enough lines for vertical angles
```

---

The issue was caused by two problems:

1. The IES file format was missing required metadata lines that the parser expected. In standard IES format, there should typically be 3 metadata lines after the counts line.

2. The IESLoader was hardcoded to skip exactly 3 lines after the counts line, which is too rigid for different IES file formats.

I've made two fixes:

1. Added the missing metadata lines to the spot.ies file to comply with standard IES format.

2. Made the IESLoader parser more flexible by detecting metadata lines instead of using a hardcoded value. Now it will scan forward until it finds a line that looks like it contains numeric data representing the vertical angles.

These changes should resolve the error and allow the IES file to be parsed correctly regardless of small variations in file format.
