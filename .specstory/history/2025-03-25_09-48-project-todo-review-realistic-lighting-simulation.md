- [x] Add realistic shadows
- [x] Implement shadow mapping
- [x] Add soft shadows

- [x] Implement specular highlights

And these items are still pending:

- [ ] Configure reflection and refraction
- [ ] Optimize shadow resolution vs. performance
- [ ] Implement client-side global illumination approximation
- [ ] Add light bouncing effects
- [ ] Implement ambient occlusion
- [ ] Add subsurface scattering for applicable materials
- [ ] Configure metallic and roughness properties

Here's the updated section of your todo list:
