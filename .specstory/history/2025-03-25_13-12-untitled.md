I'll help you revert your working directory back to the last committed state. This will discard all uncommitted changes in your project. Let me check the current state first.

---

```bash
git status | cat
```

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   package-lock.json
        modified:   package.json
        modified:   src/components/Scene.tsx
        modified:   todo

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        .specstory/history/2025-03-24_23-59-typescript-deployment-errors-trouble
shooting.md
        .specstory/history/2025-03-25_00-02-implementing-realistic-lighting-simu
lation-plan.md
        .specstory/history/2025-03-25_09-48-project-todo-review-realistic-lighti
ng-simulation.md
        .specstory/history/2025-03-25_10-01-implementing-realistic-lighting-simu
lation.md
        public/assets/

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

```

---

I see there are both modified files and untracked files. To revert everything back to the last commit state, we'll need to:
1. Discard all changes in tracked files using `git restore`
2. Remove untracked files and directories using `git clean`

Let me help you with that:

---

```bash
git restore .
```

```
eltonthomas@Eltons-Air 3d-lighting % 

```

---

Now, let's remove the untracked files. I'll use `git clean` with the `-fd` flags to remove both files and directories. I'll first show you what will be removed using the `-n` flag (dry run):

---

```bash
git clean -nfd
```

```
eltonthomas@Eltons-Air 3d-lighting % git clean -nfd
Would remove .specstory/history/2025-03-24_23-59-typescript-deployment-errors-troubleshooting.md
Would remove .specstory/history/2025-03-25_00-02-implementing-realistic-lighting-simulation-plan.md
Would remove .specstory/history/2025-03-25_09-48-project-todo-review-realistic-lighting-simulation.md
Would remove .specstory/history/2025-03-25_10-01-implementing-realistic-lighting-simulation.md
Would remove .specstory/history/2025-03-25_13-12-untitled.md
Would remove public/assets/
Would remove public/textures/
Would remove public/thumbnails/
Would remove src/assets/ies/
Would remove src/assets/models/
Would remove src/assets/textures/
Would remove src/services/
Would remove src/types/
eltonthomas@Eltons-Air 3d-lighting %
```

---

Now I'll proceed with actually removing these untracked files:

---

```bash
git clean -fd
```

```
eltonthomas@Eltons-Air 3d-lighting % git clean -fd
Removing .specstory/history/2025-03-24_23-59-typescript-deployment-errors-troubleshooting.md
Removing .specstory/history/2025-03-25_00-02-implementing-realistic-lighting-simulation-plan.md
Removing .specstory/history/2025-03-25_09-48-project-todo-review-realistic-lighting-simulation.md
Removing .specstory/history/2025-03-25_10-01-implementing-realistic-lighting-simulation.md
Removing .specstory/history/2025-03-25_13-12-untitled.md
Removing public/assets/
Removing public/textures/
Removing public/thumbnails/
Removing src/assets/ies/
Removing src/assets/models/
Removing src/assets/textures/
Removing src/services/
Removing src/types/
eltonthomas@Eltons-Air 3d-lighting %
```

---

Let's verify that everything is clean now:
