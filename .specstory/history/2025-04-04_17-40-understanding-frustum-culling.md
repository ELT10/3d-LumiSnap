Frustum culling is a performance optimization technique in 3D graphics that avoids rendering objects that aren't visible to the camera. 

A "frustum" is the pyramid-like volume that represents what your camera can see - objects outside this volume aren't visible in the final render. Frustum culling tests each object in your scene against this volume and skips rendering those outside it, significantly improving performance by reducing unnecessary draw calls.

In Three.js, this is handled automatically for meshes via the renderer, but you should manually implement it for:

1. Custom rendering operations
2. Custom update logic for objects
3. Complex scenes with many objects
4. Physics calculations

A basic implementation involves:
```javascript
// Check if object is in camera's view frustum
const frustum = new THREE.Frustum();
const matrix = new THREE.Matrix4().multiplyMatrices(
  camera.projectionMatrix,
  camera.matrixWorldInverse
);
frustum.setFromProjectionMatrix(matrix);

// In your update loop
scene.traverse(object => {
  if (object.isMesh) {
    object.visible = frustum.intersectsObject(object);
    // Or skip expensive calculations when not visible
  }
});
```

This optimization is especially important for your lighting simulation where performance is critical.
