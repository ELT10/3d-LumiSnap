## Implementation Architecture

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1-2)

```typescript

interface AIGenerationRequest {
  type: 'text' | 'image';
  prompt?: string;
  image?: File;
  style: 'isometric' | 'realistic' | 'architectural';
}

interface AIGenerationResponse {
  images: string[]; // Base64 or URLs
  metadata: {
    generationTime: number;
    model: string;
  };
}

// src/services/ai/imageGenerator.ts
class ImageGeneratorService {
  async generateFromText(prompt: string): Promise<AIGenerationResponse>
  async generateVariations(baseImage: string): Promise<AIGenerationResponse>
  async enhanceImage(image: string, edits: EditRequest): Promise<string>
}

// src/services/ai/model3DConverter.ts
class Model3DConverterService {
  async convertToGLB(imageUrl: string): Promise<Blob>
  async optimizeModel(glb: Blob): Promise<Blob>
  async validateModel(glb: Blob): Promise<ValidationResult>
}
```

### Phase 2: UI Components (Week 2-3)

```typescript
// src/components/AIWorkflow/InitialChoice.tsx
// Three-option landing screen

// src/components/AIWorkflow/TextPromptInterface.tsx
// Rich text input with style presets

// src/components/AIWorkflow/ImageVariationSelector.tsx
// Grid view with 4 generated options

// src/components/AIWorkflow/ModelPreview.tsx
// 3D preview before loading into simulator
```

### Phase 3: Integration (Week 3-4)

```typescript
// src/hooks/useAIGeneration.ts
export const useAIGeneration = () => {
  const [status, setStatus] = useState<GenerationStatus>('idle');
  const [progress, setProgress] = useState(0);
  
  const generateBuilding = async (request: AIGenerationRequest) => {
    // 1. Generate images
    // 2. Handle user selection
    // 3. Convert to 3D
    // 4. Load into scene
  };
  
  return { generateBuilding, status, progress };
};
```

## Roadblocks & Solutions

### 1. **Image-to-3D Quality Issues**
**Problem**: AI-generated 3D models may lack architectural accuracy
**Solution**: 
- Implement post-processing pipeline

- Provide manual adjustment tools

### 2. **Processing Time**
**Problem**: 30-60 seconds for full pipeline
**Solution**:
- Progressive loading with preview
- Background processing with status updates

**Solution**:
- Automated validation and repair
- Fallback to simplified geometry
- Manual override options

## Enhanced Features & Opportunities

## Conclusion

This AI enhancement transforms your lighting simulation app into a revolutionary design tool. The combination of Gemini 2.0's image generation with modern 3D reconstruction creates a unique value proposition. The iterative editing capability through image manipulation is particularly innovative and could become a key differentiator.

The technical implementation is feasible with current technologies, though quality and cost optimization will require ongoing refinement. Starting with an MVP using open-source tools (TripoSR) for proof of concept, then upgrading to commercial APIs for production is the recommended approach.
